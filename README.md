In this exercise, I've written my own implementations of some commonly used Enumerable methods, following the [Ruby documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html) as closely as I could.

This project helped me understand those methods a lot better, taught me how to read the Ruby documentation, and forced me to *really* learn how to pass blocks and procs to my methods.

The hardest method to duplicate was `#inject`, since there are so many possibilities depending on the arguments or block specified.
